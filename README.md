* The user enters details for a new meal in the "Enter the Meal Details" panel. When they click submit, the app validates that the value in each field is numeric. If the form is valid, the "Customer Charges" panel and data model for the My Earnings view should update accordingly.
* In the "Customer Charges" panel, Subtotal is the value of the base meal price plus tax. Tip is the dollar value of the tip, given the subtotal and tip percentage. Total is equal to subtotal plus tip.
* If the user clicks cancel, the form should be reset to its initial state.
